    "## What does this document do\n",
    "This calculation turns battery capacity around, and asks, you have a device that does some job, how many jobs can you do?.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Each job uses high power, but the device also uses a smaller amount of power all the time (its *standby consumption*).\n",
    "\n",
    "How many jobs can you do in a day, before you need to recharge?\n",
    "\n",
    "Battery capacity is measured in Ampere-Hours, that is Amps multiplied by Hours.   Its a literal trade-off---draw a lot of amps, you only get a few hours; draw a fraction of an amp, and you get lots of hours.  A 10Ah battery can theoretically deliver 10 Amps for 1 hour, one Amp for 10 hours, or 500mA for 20 hours.   In reality, the relationship might not be so *linear*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rated capacity from the manufacturer is usually for a 20 hour discharge, so if you are going to run the battery for a shorter or longer time, you may experience a different effective capacity.    Also, resellers lie outrageously about capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your load is constant (eg you draw 200mA all the time, then a theoretical lifetime is simply `capacity / current`, eg `10Ah / 200mA => 50 hours`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are considering a 24 hour discharge, we are close to the manufacturer figure, but practically \n",
    "we are using different rates, our gadget will be in standby (sleep mode) when possible and only consume our **peak draw** when doing a job.  The rest of the time we consume a far smaller **standby draw**\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use Python and the *Pint* unit library to help us model this scenario."
