    "\n",
    "You have a battery, and you want to draw some power from it.   How long will it last?\n",
    "\n",
    "Battery capacity is measured in Ampere-Hours, that is Amps multiplied Hours.   Its a literal trade-off---draw a lot of amps, you only get a few hours; draw a fraction of an amp, and you get lots of hours.  A 10Ah battery can theoretically deliver 10 Amps for 1 hour, one Amp for 10 hours, or 500mA for 20 hours.   In reality, the relationship might not be so *linear*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rated capacity from the manufacturer is usually for a 20 hour discharge, so if you are going to run the battery for a shorter or longer time, you may experience a different effective capacity.    Also, resellers lie outrageously about capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your load is constant (eg you draw 200mA all the time, then a theoretical lifetime is simply `capacity / current`, eg `10Ah / 200mA => 50 hours`.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if you need more life?  Then we need to go to low-power (sleep mode) when possible and only consume our **peak draw** for brief intervals.  The rest of the time we consume a far smaller **idle draw**\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use Python and the *Pint* unit library to help us model this scenario."
