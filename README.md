## Batteries 

Batteries are hard.   There are a lot of fudge factors and you often
have to wrestle with unit coversions.  Yes, I know /you/ know there
are 525600 minutes in a year, and why.

I gave a presentation once at [lca](linux.conf.au) about battery
power.   Watch the video below for the long form.

The short form is the calculations in this repository, which are
worksheets that let you enter your basic numbers (size of battery, and
how much power you need), and deliver answers.
